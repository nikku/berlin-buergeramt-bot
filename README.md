# Berlin BÃ¼rgeramt Appointment Bot

A bot that sends a notification when a buergeramt appointment is available. 
It periodically checks the given buergeramt appointment page for new appointments. 

It then notifies the user locally via [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier) when appointments are available.

**Please use responsibly**: Set a USER_AGENT containing contact information in case something goes wrong.

**USE AT OWN RISK**


## Limitations

Currently this bot is only checking the current and the next month, as I was mainly going for appointments on short notice.


## Getting started

* clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/similicious/berlin-buergeramt-bot 
```

* cd into the cloned repository
* install dependencies

```
npm install
```

* create .env by copying .env.sample

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

* edit .env to suit your needs

```
BOOKING_URL=The link to the appointments page. Use the link behind "Termin buchen" or "Termin berlinweit suchen" buttons.
USER_AGENT=A string containing your email address
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=The interval in minutes to check
HEALTHCHECKS_IO_TOKEN=Optional healthchecks.io token to monitor the bot
```

* start

```

Optionally, you can use a node process manager like pm2 to monitor the app and automatically start the bot on boot.


## Run tests

I included some snapshots of appointment pages in various states. Execute test with

```
npm test
```
